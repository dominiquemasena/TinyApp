# TinyApp Project

This repository is a compilation of files created to put to together for the first LHL project submission: TinyApp. 

The goal of the project is to be a platform where the user can register an account, log in, create shortened URLs and use those URLs to access various websites. 

I will embed screenshot of the application.

# Getting Started

1. Download the repository to your computer.
2. Install required packages such as Nodemon.
3. Run npm start and navigate the application.
